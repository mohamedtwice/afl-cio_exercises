# AFL-CIO Exercises #

### Exercise 1 ###
[x] Combine the 2012 and 2014 volunteer shift files.

[x] For this analysis, we only care about “Completed” shifts. Remove all shifts who don’t have a Status that is “Completed.”

[x] For this analysis, we only want to study folks who did Walks, Phone Banks, Data Entry, or GOTV (Get Out The Vote). Remove shifts that have any other role.

[x] Collapse this data file from the shift level, to the person level. You can de-duplicate on My Campaign ID, only keeping the record with only keeping the record with the most recent shift end date.

[x] Bonus: try counting the number of walk, phone bank, data entry, and GOTV shifts that each person (each unique My Campaign ID) performed.

### Exercise 2 ###
Tracking affiliate participation in our program

[x] Combine the 2012 and 2014 volunteer shift files.

[x] Combine the “Participant International” and “International Name” fields into a single column

### Exercise 3 ###
Here’s what we’d like to know:
- For each election cycle, what union had the highest number of volunteers?
* AFSME in 2012 and CWA in 2014
- For each election cycle, what state had the highest number of volunteers?
* OH in both 2012 and 2014
- Do certain unions seem to have a particularly strong volunteer base in certain states? Specifically, which unions should we reach out to first for volunteers if we are running an Ohio program? How about if we are running a Pennsylvania program?
* AFSCME has the most volunteers in OH and PA over both 2012 and 2014 cycles
- Which union had the most walk shifts in 2014? How about the most phone bank shifts?
* (was not able to complete)
- Is there anything else interesting or noteworthy you can tell us about this data?
* From 2012 to 2014, AFSCME and USW volunteers dropped significantly 

### Exercise 4 ###
